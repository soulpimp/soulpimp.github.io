Throughout the development of The Globe and Mail's digital subscription project, Craig played a key role on the core team responsible for delivering the functionality required to identify subscribers and convince people who hadn't subscribed to give the product a chance. 

One thing that stood out during the project and was definitely appreciated by the other developers on the team was his willingness to take something that was a working prototype or 90 percent done, and then shape or refine the HTML, Javascript and CSS around it so that it we had something we were ready to ship. Craig is a tremendous individual contributor and an excellent team member. 

I definitely recommend him to anyone who has difficult problems they need to solve well.
