I had the pleasure of working with Craig during a period when our company scaled from 20 to 60 Methoders. He rolled with the punches as our team grew, tried out new processes, and changed directions a few times. He showed leadership, and kept his teammates steered in the right direction. 

He is a very strong front-end developer. He implemented frameworks such as Sass, and foundation, and proved his ability to go from idea to production, and everything in between. He’s passionate about UI, UX, coding standards, semantic HTML, and was an active contributor within the team. He was more than a dev - when the scrum master was away, he’d step in to take the lead and keep things moving. 

I recommend Craig to anyone looking for a senior front end dev.
